Unlike what the link itself suggests, this kaggle user collected data from international football matches start- ing from the very first official match in 1872 up to 2024. The dataset contains only men’s first team matches, and does not include matches from the Olympic Games. In the words of the user: “The data is gathered from several sources including but not limited to Wikipedia, rsssf.com, and individual football associations’ websites.”


shootouts.csv

The shootouts dataset contains data for every international penalty shootout since 1967. Once again, there is information showing the two teams that played (home_team and away_team) and the date of each shootout (date). Each row contains the winner of the shootout (winner), and some rows even show which team took the first penalty in the shootout (first_shooter).
